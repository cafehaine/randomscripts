Random scripts that IÂ use that don't deserve a full repo


 * create-arch-chroot.sh: Creates a temporary installation of arch linux. Useful
 to test package building.
 * sadm-random-stuff.sh: For use with prologin/sadm. Verify that packages exist,
 and then compiles the aur packages.
 * aurgraph.py: Create a graph of the aur packages that depend on packages made by a specific maintainer. Great to see how many computers you could infect if you decide to go rogue with a package you own ðŸ¤·
